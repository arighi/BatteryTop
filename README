= BatteryTop =

Android application to show detailed battery informations in a top-like format.

== How to build the application in debug-mode ==

These are the steps to build the application in debug-mode and test it on any
Android device.

 - download the latest Android SDK (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

 - build the application (be sure to replace the path below):
   $ ant -Dsdk.dir=/path/to/android/sdk/root/dir debug

NOTE: instead of always passing the path of the Android SDK from the command
line, you can also store the path into the file local.properties:

   $ echo sdk.dir=/home/righiandr/Software/android-sdk-linux_x86 > local.properties

 - install the application to the device
   $ adb install bin/BatteryTop-debug.apk
